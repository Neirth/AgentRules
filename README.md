# AgentRules

**Professional-grade instructions and methodologies for Claude AI assistants**

AgentRules is a curated collection of domain-specific rules and skills designed to enhance Claude's capabilities across software engineering, mathematics, and design disciplines. Think of it as the `.claude` configuration for any project that wants to leverage specialized AI assistance.

## 🎯 Philosophy

### Context-Aware Intelligence

AgentRules is built on the principle that AI assistants should **adapt their expertise** to the task at hand. Rather than being a generalist, Claude becomes a specialized expert by:

1. **Understanding First** - Reading project documentation and conventions before making changes
2. **Role Adaptation** - Switching between reverse engineer, QA engineer, software architect, ML engineer, mathematician, or designer based on what's needed
3. **Following Conventions** - Matching existing project patterns and style guides
4. **Minimal Intervention** - Making the smallest, most surgical changes necessary
5. **Verification-First** - Testing changes before considering them complete

### Quality Through Specialization

Each skill and rule set in this repository represents distilled knowledge from:

- **Industry Leaders**: Netflix, Spotify, Uber, AWS engineering practices
- **Academic Excellence**: MIT, Harvard, UPV research and methodologies
- **Foundational Works**: Gang of Four (Design Patterns), Robert C. Martin (Clean Code/SOLID), Eric Evans (Domain-Driven Design)
- **Modern Standards**: TDD, Event-Driven Architecture, Machine Learning best practices

### Rules vs Skills

- **Rules** (`rules/`): Quick-reference guidelines automatically loaded for every task. Concise, practical, immediately applicable.
- **Skills** (`skills/`): Deep-dive methodologies invoked on-demand with `/skill-name`. Comprehensive workflows, patterns, and best practices.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Git Submodule (Recommended)

Add AgentRules as a submodule in your project's `.claude` directory:

```bash
# In your project root
git submodule add https://github.com/Neirth/AgentRules.git .claude
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This makes the rules and skills available to Claude when working on your project.

### Option 2: Direct Clone

Clone AgentRules and rename to `.claude`:

```bash
# In your project root
git clone https://github.com/Neirth/AgentRules.git .claude
```

### Option 3: Template Integration

Copy specific rules and skills you need into your project's `.claude/` directory:

```bash
# Copy only what you need
mkdir -p .claude/rules/computer-science
cp path/to/AgentRules/rules/computer-science/software-engineering.md .claude/rules/computer-science/
```

### Using Skills

Once integrated, invoke skills by mentioning them in your conversation with Claude:

```
"Use /software-engineering to refactor this code following SOLID principles"
"Apply /qa-engineering to add comprehensive tests for this module"
"Use /reverse-engineering to analyze and reimplement this external library"
```
