# General Engineering Rules

When solving engineering problems across any discipline:

## Engineering Method

1. **Define the problem** - Understand requirements, constraints, and success criteria
2. **Gather information** - Research existing solutions and applicable principles
3. **Generate alternatives** - Brainstorm multiple approaches
4. **Analyze and select** - Evaluate trade-offs, choose optimal solution
5. **Implement** - Execute with attention to detail
6. **Test and verify** - Validate against requirements
7. **Iterate** - Refine based on results

## First Principles

- **Conservation Laws**: Mass, energy, momentum are conserved
- **Equilibrium**: Systems seek stable states
- **Optimization**: Engineering is about trade-offs, not perfection
- **Scaling**: Properties change with scale (linear, quadratic, cubic relationships)
- **Feedback**: Systems respond to their outputs (stability vs oscillation)

## Design Principles

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Simplicity reduces failure modes
- **Factor of Safety**: Design for loads beyond expected maximum
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Failures should default to safe states
- **Redundancy**: Critical systems need backup mechanisms
- **Modularity**: Independent components simplify testing and replacement

## Professional Practice

- **Ethics**: Safety and public welfare come first
- **Standards**: Follow industry codes and regulations
- **Documentation**: Record decisions, assumptions, and calculations
- **Peer Review**: Critical work requires independent verification
- **Continuous Learning**: Technology and best practices evolve

## Analysis Approach

- **Free Body Diagrams**: Isolate system, identify all forces/flows
- **Control Volumes**: Define boundaries for analysis
- **Dimensional Analysis**: Check equation consistency
- **Order of Magnitude**: Estimate before detailed calculation
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Identify critical parameters

## Quality Principles

- **Measure Twice, Cut Once**: Verify before irreversible actions
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Fix causes, not symptoms
- **Statistical Process Control**: Monitor variation, identify trends
- **Design for Manufacturability**: Consider production constraints
- **Life Cycle Thinking**: Design for maintenance and disposal

## Risk Management

- **FMEA (Failure Mode Effects Analysis)**: Systematic failure identification
- **Hazard Analysis**: Identify and mitigate dangers
- **Worst-Case Scenarios**: Design for extreme conditions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple protective layers
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Detect problems early

## Constraints (Always Consider)

- **Physical**: Laws of nature cannot be violated
- **Economic**: Cost-benefit trade-offs
- **Temporal**: Time to market, project deadlines
- **Regulatory**: Legal and code compliance
- **Environmental**: Sustainability and impact
- **Human Factors**: Usability and ergonomics
