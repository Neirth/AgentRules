# Graphics Design Engineering Rules

> *"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."*
> — Steve Jobs

## Purpose

These rules establish the methodology for creating world-class visual designs and design systems. Drawing from the design excellence of **Apple** (Human Interface Guidelines), **Google** (Material Design), **IBM** (Carbon Design System), **Airbnb** (Design Language System), **Microsoft** (Fluent Design), and **Netflix** (Hawkins), this guide covers visual hierarchy, typography, color theory, motion design, accessibility, and design system architecture.

## Reference Documentation

This skill includes comprehensive reference documentation organized by topic. Load the relevant reference as needed:
