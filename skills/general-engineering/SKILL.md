# General Engineering

This skill encompasses universal engineering principles and foundational methodologies applicable across all engineering disciplines.

## Core Capabilities

This skill covers the following areas, each detailed in the `references/` directory:

- **classical-mathematical** - Mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, optimization, and simulation following MIT, Harvard, Oxford, Berkeley curricula
- **formal-verification** - Mathematical proof of code correctness using theorem proving and model checking (C/C++/Rust only)
- **qa-engineering** - Test-Driven Development, test coverage, mocking, chaos engineering, testing culture

## How to Use This Skill

Reference specific capabilities from the `references/` directory based on your task:

- For **mathematical modeling and analysis**: See [classical-mathematical.md](references/classical-mathematical.md)
- For **proving code correctness**: See [formal-verification.md](references/formal-verification.md)
- For **testing and quality assurance**: See [qa-engineering.md](references/qa-engineering.md)
