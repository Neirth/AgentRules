# General Engineering Principles and Methodologies

> *"Engineering is the art of modeling materials we do not wholly understand, into shapes we cannot precisely analyze, so as to withstand forces we cannot properly assess, in such a way that the public has no reason to suspect the extent of our ignorance."*
> — Dr. A. R. Dykes (British Institution of Structural Engineers)

## Purpose

These principles establish the foundational methodologies, analytical frameworks, and professional practices common to all engineering disciplines. Whether designing bridges, circuits, chemical processes, or software systems, these universal principles guide sound engineering judgment.
