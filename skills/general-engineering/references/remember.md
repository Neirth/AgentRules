## Remember

> *"Engineering is the art of the practical and depends more on the total state of the art than it does on the individual excellence of the artist."*

Engineering excellence comes from:

1. **Solid Fundamentals**: Master first principles
2. **Practical Experience**: Learn from real applications
3. **Intellectual Humility**: Know what you don't know
4. **Ethical Foundation**: Public welfare paramount
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from every project

**The hallmark of good engineering:**

Not the most elegant solution, nor the most advanced technology, but the solution that:
- Meets requirements reliably
- Can be built within constraints
- Operates safely over its life
- Provides value to stakeholders
- Considers broader impacts

**When in doubt:**
1. Return to first principles
2. Consult standards and codes
3. Seek expert review
4. Document assumptions and decisions
5. Err on the side of safety
