## Engineering Judgment

### When to Calculate vs. Estimate

**Detailed Calculation Required:**
- Critical safety systems
- Legal or regulatory documentation
- Close to limits (small margin)
- Expensive to change later
- Novel or unusual design

**Estimation Acceptable:**
- Preliminary design (order of magnitude)
- Large margins of safety
- Well-established applications
- Quick feasibility check
- Uncritical components

**Progressive Refinement:**

1. **Concept**: Order of magnitude (±50%)
2. **Preliminary**: Simplified models (±20%)
3. **Detailed**: Full analysis (±5%)
4. **Verification**: Testing and validation

### Recognizing Limits of Expertise

**When to Seek Help:**
- Unfamiliar with technology or method
- Outside your licensed discipline
- Regulatory requirements beyond your knowledge
- Novel application of existing principles
- Failure could be catastrophic

**Consulting Specialists:**
- Clearly define question or problem
- Provide complete context
- Ask for explanation, not just answer
- Document advice received
- Understand limitations of advice

**Continuous Learning:**
- Technology evolves
- Codes and standards update
- New methods develop
- Cross-disciplinary knowledge valuable
