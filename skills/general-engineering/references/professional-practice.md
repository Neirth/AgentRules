## Professional Engineering Practice

### Ethics and Responsibility

**Fundamental Canon** (from NSPE Code of Ethics):

> *"Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public."*

**Ethical Obligations:**

1. **Public Safety**: When safety conflicts with other interests, safety wins
2. **Competence**: Work only within your expertise or with supervision
3. **Honesty**: Truthful representation of qualifications and findings
4. **Conflicts of Interest**: Disclose potential conflicts
5. **Credit**: Acknowledge contributions of others
6. **Professional Development**: Maintain and expand competence

**Ethical Dilemmas - Decision Framework:**

1. **Identify** the ethical issue
2. **Determine** the stakeholders and their interests
3. **Consider** applicable codes, laws, and principles
4. **Evaluate** alternative courses of action
5. **Choose** the action that best serves public welfare
6. **Document** your reasoning

**Historical Case: Challenger Disaster (1986)**

Engineers at Morton Thiokol warned against launching in cold temperatures. Management overruled concerns. Result: catastrophic failure, seven deaths.

**Lesson**: Engineers must advocate for safety even under pressure. When overruled, document concerns in writing.

### Standards and Codes

**Purpose:**
- Ensure minimum safety levels
- Provide proven design methods
- Enable interoperability
- Reduce redundant work

**Types:**

1. **Design Codes**: Prescriptive requirements
   - Example: ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code
   - Example: National Electrical Code (NEC)
   - Example: Building codes (IBC)

2. **Performance Standards**: Outcome-based requirements
   - Example: Crash test standards for vehicles
   - Example: Energy efficiency requirements

3. **Test Methods**: Standardized procedures
   - Example: ASTM test methods
   - Example: ISO testing standards

4. **Product Standards**: Specifications for components
   - Example: Pipe dimensions (ANSI/ASME)
   - Example: Bolt grades (SAE)

**Using Standards:**
- Identify applicable standards early in design
- Use latest edition unless otherwise specified
- Understand when standards are legally required vs. recommended
- Document which standards you followed
- Know when to seek exceptions (with proper justification)

### Documentation

**Purposes:**
1. **Communication**: Share design intent
2. **Legal protection**: Evidence of proper design process
3. **Maintenance**: Guide future work
4. **Knowledge transfer**: Train new team members
5. **Reproducibility**: Allow independent verification

**Essential Documentation:**

**Design Calculations:**
```
Title: Beam Deflection Analysis
Date: 2024-01-15
Engineer: [Name]
Checker: [Name]
Project: [Project Name]

Problem Statement:
[Clear description of what is being analyzed]

Assumptions:
1. [List all assumptions]
2. [Include justification if non-obvious]

Given:
[Input parameters with units]

Analysis:
[Step-by-step calculations]
[Free body diagrams or sketches]
[Equation references]

Results:
[Clearly stated conclusions]
[Comparison to acceptance criteria]

References:
[Codes, standards, textbooks used]
```

**Decision Documentation:**

Record major design decisions:
- What alternatives were considered?
- Why was this option selected?
- What trade-offs were made?
- What assumptions were critical?

**As-Built Documentation:**

Capture deviations from original design:
- Field changes during construction
- Material substitutions
- Dimension variations
- Non-conformances and resolutions

### Peer Review

**Purpose**: Independent verification by qualified engineer

**When Required:**
- Complex or innovative designs
- Critical safety systems
- Regulatory compliance
- High-consequence failures

**Levels:**

1. **Informal Review**: Colleague checks work
2. **Formal Review**: Documented independent check
3. **Design Review Board**: Panel evaluates major decisions
4. **Independent Verification**: Completely separate analysis

**Review Process:**

1. **Prepare**: Package complete design documentation
2. **Review**: Reviewer examines independently
3. **Comment**: Reviewer identifies issues, asks questions
4. **Resolve**: Designer addresses comments
5. **Approve**: Reviewer signs off (or iterates)

**Effective Reviews:**
- Reviewer must be competent in subject area
- Sufficient time allocated (rule of thumb: 25% of design time)
- Clear scope and acceptance criteria
- Non-adversarial atmosphere
- Documentation of resolution
