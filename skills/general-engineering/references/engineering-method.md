## The Engineering Method

### Universal Problem-Solving Framework

Engineering, at its core, is applied problem-solving under constraints. The engineering method provides a systematic approach:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ 1. Define       │  What exactly is the problem? What are the requirements?
│    Problem      │  What are the constraints? What defines success?
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│ 2. Research &   │  What solutions exist? What principles apply?
│    Analyze      │  What data is available? What is unknown?
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│ 3. Generate     │  Brainstorm alternatives. Think divergently.
│    Alternatives │  Challenge assumptions. Consider unconventional approaches.
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│ 4. Evaluate &   │  Analyze trade-offs. Use decision matrices.
│    Select       │  Consider: performance, cost, risk, feasibility.
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│ 5. Detailed     │  Specify completely. Calculate precisely.
│    Design       │  Document assumptions. Follow codes/standards.
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│ 6. Implement    │  Execute with quality control.
│    & Build      │  Inspect at critical stages. Verify as-built.
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│ 7. Test &       │  Does it meet requirements? Is it safe?
│    Validate     │  Performance testing. Acceptance criteria.
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│ 8. Iterate &    │  Learn from results. Refine design.
│    Improve      │  Continuous improvement. Lessons learned.
└─────────────────┘

### Critical Questions at Each Stage

**Problem Definition:**
- What is the actual need? (Not just stated want)
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What are the success criteria? (Measurable, testable)
- What are the hard constraints? (Cannot be violated)
- What are soft constraints? (Preferences, optimizations)

**Research & Analysis:**
- Has this been solved before? Where? How?
- What physical principles govern this problem?
- What standards or regulations apply?
- What failure modes exist in similar systems?
- What is the state of the art?

**Alternative Generation:**
- Have we considered at least 3 different approaches?
- What if we removed each constraint one at a time?
- Can we combine approaches?
- What would the simplest possible solution look like?

**Evaluation & Selection:**
- What are the objective criteria? (Cost, performance, reliability)
- What are the subjective criteria? (Aesthetics, user experience)
- What are the risks and unknowns for each alternative?
- Is there a reversible decision? (Prefer reversible choices early)
- What is the expected life cycle cost?
